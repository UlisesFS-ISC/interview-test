## Updates

### 3/11/2018
* I decided to create another branch to continue developing this assessment app further, for my implementation submission
 was just set to provide functionality without adding anything in regards of modules or frameworks (aside from firebase and meteor sessions)
* Redux + Saga implementation for the structure of the app.
* Modal handling refactor for each page.
